# React-app-initializer

This project contains a script in javascript which initialize a react application based on:
- Create-react-app
- Typescript
- Scss
- Material UI

Just start the script with node:
```
node initializer.js [path to your directory where you want your project folder] [your project name (uppercases are not allowed)]
```

Example:
```
node ./initializer.js /Users/rael/Documents/react-projects initialized-project
```

Or, you can set the initializer.js as an executable:
```
sudo chmod +x ./initializer.js
```
Then start it:
```
initializer.js [path to your directory where you want your project folder] [your project name (uppercases are not allowed)]
```

Example:
```
./initializer.js /Users/rael/Documents/react-projects initialized-project
```


The process needs a few minutes to finish.

Enjoy!
